### 🎯 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the species of Irish flowers using machine learning models. The dataset contains the following features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Class Label (Species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The notebook demonstrates:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.

Model Training: Using Logistic Regression and Neural Networks to predict flower species.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

### 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning (Logistic Regression).

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training neural networks.

### 🚀 How to Run the Code
git clone https://github.com/ABILASHGOVINDH/Irish_Flower_Prediction.git
cd Irish_Flower_Prediction

### 2.Install Dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow jupyter

##3.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook


### 📊 Key Insights from the Project
#### 1. Data Exploration 📈
The dataset contains 24 samples with 5 features.

The target variable (class label) has 5 unique classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica, Iris-setosa, and Iris-versicolor.

#### 2. Data Visualization 📉
Histograms and box plots were used to visualize the distribution of sepal and petal measurements.

The plots revealed clear distinctions between different flower species.

#### 3. Model Training 🤖
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of ~90% on the test set.

Neural Network: Built using TensorFlow/Keras, achieving similar performance.

#### 4. Evaluation 🎯
Classification reports and confusion matrices were used to evaluate model performance.

Both models performed well, with high accuracy and precision.
